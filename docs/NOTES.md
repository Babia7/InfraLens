# InfraLens Notes

## Identity Core (Manifesto)
Version: 4.2.0 // Codename: HUMAN_PRIMACY  
Status: Operational // Field Ready

**InfraLens** is the Cognition Layer for Arista Systems Engineers and Sales teams (Account Managers, pre-sales SEs). It externalizes complexity—spanning silicon physics to executive outcomes—so humans can decide with clarity. It is not an agent; it amplifies judgment.

### The Problem: Cognitive Entropy
The SE must oscillate between micro-physics (buffers, SerDes), macro-strategy (ROI, TCO), and human dynamics (stakeholder anxiety). Holding all of this in memory creates entropy; InfraLens acts as an external SysDB.

### Operating Modes
- **Reasoning (Constraint Mapping):** AI Fabric Designer, TCO Modeler, MTTR Insurance. Logic: “Don’t guess. Calculate.”
- **Practice (Applied Skills):** EOS Linux Lab, CloudVision Field Guide, Protocol Translation. Logic: “Skill is earned through repetition.”
- **Reference (High-Fidelity Grounding):** Release Note Deconstructor, Architecture Codex. Logic: “Verification over Assumption.”
- **Delivery (Narrative Projection):** Briefing Theater, Demo Command. Logic: “Sales is the transfer of confidence.”

### Mandate
In an era of hyper-specialization, We at PolymathOS as a collective choose breadth as a competitive advantage. InfraLens is built on the belief that the most interesting solutions occur at the intersection of disparate fields.

### Evolution
- Phase 1: Reference intelligence (guides, calculators, summarization) — completed.
- Phase 2: Structured reasoning (failure pre-mortem, constraint topology, ASIC pipeline X-ray) — in progress.
- Phase 3: Durable cognition (SCIF/air-gap, field vision scanning, guided RCA) — future.

## Strategic Definition (Roadmap Extract)
North Star: InfraLens is a cognition layer for infrastructure—producing durable, defensible artifacts that move account teams from “convincing” to “proving.”

- **Capability Layers:** constraint mapping, failure pre-mortem, tradeoff matrices; ADR/briefing memo generators; live TCO snapshots; 5 Whys/checklists; causal chain and metric contextualizers.
- **Exclusion Zones:** no AI roleplay/personas; no agentic “do-er” behaviors; no decorative gimmicks; no debate bots.
- **Before vs After:** from demo novelty to rigor and proof; from transient screen-share to durable artifacts.

## Architectural Ledger (Sample Entry)
**Entry:** 2025-05-15T18:00:00Z — FORGE_EVOLUTION_0.6  
**Objective:** Shift identity from “app store” to “sense-making system.”  
**Implementation:** Renamed catalogs (Organic, Technic, Inference, Intel); updated `AppShowcase` UI labels; aligned data interfaces/initial data.  
**Outcome:** Positions PolymathOS as a cognitive laboratory with “cybernetic interventions,” not just apps.
